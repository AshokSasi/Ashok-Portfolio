<p>Below are some of our favorite projects!!</p>
<br/>
    <h3>1. Durak Game with GUI</h3>
    <p>One of my favorite projects was the creation of the russian card game Durak in C#. The game was developed with 4 other classmates. 
       The game contains a simple GUI along with extra feature such as a fully functional Computer player, advanced turn swapping mechanics,
       and game stat logging.
